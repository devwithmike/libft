# Libft - C - 2019

Libft is a library we created in C to help us during the WeThinkCode journey.

## WeThinkCode:

**Part 1:** 28/28  
**Part 2:** 24/24  
**Bonus:**  0/6  
**Five Extra:** 5/5  
  
**Total:** 111/125

## Installation:

To get started, clone the Libft repo and go into the folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/mikefmeyer/libft
cd libft/
```

### Making:

To compile the libft, you need to run the following commands:

```
make
```

## Using the library:

To use the library, you need to add "#include "libft.h"" in your name and change the directory of your libft.h.
If you add a function to the library, you'll need to add the function in the libft.h file and the Makefile.

### Compiling with libft.a

Run the following command, by adding your main file and all other files you want to compile.

```
gcc [Your Main] [Other Files] libft.a
./a.out
```

## Disclaimer:

The functions I've altered have been altered by changing my code partly. This libft won't be changed regularly as this is only 
for my github. I have another private repo in which I will add my new functions through the year.

## Don't be a GitHub hero!

Come and talk to me before using my code. Some of the functions have been altered from the one I pushed.
Before you use it and mess up, come talk to me.
I can explain to you what is does and how to do it yourself.
You won't learn anything by just taking code.
Thanks!
